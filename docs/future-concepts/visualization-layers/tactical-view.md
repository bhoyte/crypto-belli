- **Market Volatility**: Terrain Dynamism
- **Market Sentiment**: Atmospheric Conditions

## Terrain Generation Mechanics

### Terrain Mapping Algorithm
1. **Base Terrain Generation**
   - Market Cap: Fundamental Landscape Shape
   - 24-Hour Price Change: Terrain Elevation
   - Trading Volume: Terrain Density and Texture

#### Terrain Type Classifications
- **Bullish Terrain**
  - Expansive, rolling landscapes
  - Verdant, fertile appearance
  - Smooth, progressive elevation

- **Bearish Terrain**
  - Rugged, contracted landscapes
  - Sparse, harsh environmental conditions
  - Sharp, dramatic elevation changes

### Detailed Terrain Components

#### 1. Elevation Mapping
- **Height Calculation**
  - Absolute price value as base elevation
  - Percentage change as slope steepness
  - Direction of change as elevation gradient

#### 2. Texture and Composition
- **Market Sentiment Visualization**
  - Color saturation representing market mood
  - Texture density indicating market stability
  - Surface irregularities showing volatility

## Dynamic Movement Mechanics

### Troop/Asset Movement Representation
- **Price Trajectory Visualization**
  - Upward Movements: Advancing Formations
  - Downward Movements: Tactical Retreats
