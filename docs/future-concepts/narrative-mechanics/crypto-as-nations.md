## Narrative Generation Framework

### Procedural Nation-Building Mechanics
1. **Origin Story Generator**
   - Algorithmic creation of founding narratives
   - Incorporate real technological milestones
   - Add elements of technological mythology

2. **Conflict and Collaboration Scenarios**
   - Dynamic generation of "diplomatic relations"
   - Market interaction as geopolitical events
   - Procedural history of crypto "world" interactions

## Visualization Approach

### Nation Representation Layers
- **Visual Identity**
  - Color palette representing technological ethos
  - Symbolic iconography based on core technology
  - Animated national "emblem"

- **Market Interaction Visualization**
  - Price movements as territorial expansions/contractions
  - Trading volume as military mobilization
  - Market cap as national infrastructure development
